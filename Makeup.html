<h1>Makeup</h1>

<p>I am passionate about makeup.</p>

<p>I am passionate about makeup because it is something very fun to do, it's art but on your face.  I would love to get my MUA Certificate after graduating from Univeristry with my Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering.</p>

<p>I was introduced to Makeup in middle school, I started watching videos of makeup artist doing their makeup and giving tutorials and I found it very satisfying.</p>

<p>Someone that served as an inspiration for me is a makeup artist called Mireya MUA, thanks to her videos and courses I have learned easier ways to do makeup on myself and other people.</p>

<p>What continues to inspire me is seeing how girls are becoming makeup artist and doing amazing especially with small amount of years they have doing makeup.</p>

<h1>Makeup</h1>

<p>I am passionate about makeup.</p>

<p>I am passionate about makeup because it is something very fun to do, its art but in your face.  I would love to get my MUA Certificate after graduating from Univeristry with my Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering.</p>

<p>I was introduced to Makeup in middle school, I started watching videos of makeup artist doing their makeup and giving tutorials and I found it very satisfying.

    Someone that served as an inspiration for me is a makeup artist called Mireya MUA, thanks to her videos and courses I have learned easier ways to do makeup on myself and other people.

    What continues to inspire me is seeing how girls are becoming makeup artist and doing amazing especially with small amount of years they have doing makeup."</p>
